# Simple Social Media 

The goal of this project was to create a simple social media site using flask and sqlite. The goal is to caputre the user's id, name and content. Once done, we save on a database and can see the posts of prior when disconnecting / reconnecting to server. 

## Usage

### Libraries

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
from flask_cors import CORS 
from midman import create_post, get_posts
```
